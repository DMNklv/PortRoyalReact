## Project Overview

PortRoyalReact is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack web application created as both a personal learning initiative and a potential portfolio project. The aim is to reproduce a tabletop card game experience in a modern web environment while exploring and mastering popular libraries and frameworks. The current focus is on building robust, clean front-end logic with React and Redux Toolkit, while plans for integrating the back end remain underway.

### Front-End Development

The front end is constructed using React JS, with Redux Toolkit employed for state management. All styling and animations are hand-crafted, avoiding the use of CSS frameworks such as Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap. The current implementation supports gameplay for up to five players, statically configured, and demonstrates core aspects of game logic and user interaction. High code quality and a clear component structure are central to the development process, with an emphasis on maintainability and scalability for future features.

### Planned Features

Several future enhancements are mapped out to bring the project closer to completion and enhance its usability:
- **Authentication and User Accounts:** Secure login and registration processes to manage player identities and provide personalized experiences.
- **Game Lobby and Friend System:** Features like lobby creation, friend management, user blocking, and real-time chat to support social play.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay:** Dynamic turn rotation, player management, and robust multiplayer logic to reflect the mechanics of the original card game.
- **User Personalization:** Support for profile avatars, customizable game table backgrounds, light/dark themes, and user-specific preferences.

### Audience and Usage

This repository is designed primarily for learning the MERN stack through hands-on experience and experimentation. There is also an intent for it to serve as a showcase in a development portfolio. In addition, the project could be used by friends for casual gaming, mirroring the collaborative aspect of the tabletop card game at its core.

---

### Current Status

PortRoyalReact is still under active development and is not yet publicly deployed or released. The front end is nearing completion for basic static gameplay, while back-end features such as authentication, multiplayer support, and data persistence are planned for future development. As progress continues, the integration of a Node.js and Express backend, real-time interactions with Socket.IO, and ongoing improvement of user-facing features are next on the roadmap.

### Design and Architectural Choices

Development emphasizes comprehensive understanding of the MERN stack, with a strong focus on writing custom styles and animations rather than relying on pre-built solutions. This approach is also intended to deepen knowledge of CSS and UI design principles. To ensure manageable learning and solid fundamentals, back-end and real-time features are being prototyped in simpler projects (such as [RockPaperScissors](https://github.com/DMNklv/RockPaperScissors)) before being integrated into PortRoyalReact, paving the way for a complex, feature-rich web application.
